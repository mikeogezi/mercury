# Mercury

This is the Mercury, a tool for rapidly iterating on visual ideas. I worked on this during an [Amii Hack Night](https://www.amii.ca/) and presented it at [DemoCamp 57](https://democampyeg.com/).

[Here's a demo video](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/adc017ba-5398-4e90-97b8-09729dd05753)

Detailed instructions on how to get this running are available in the submodules: [Mercury UI](https://github.com/mikeogezi/mercury-ui) and [Mercury Backend](https://github.com/mikeogezi/mercury-backend).
