# Mercury

This is the Mercury, a tool for rapidly iterating on visual ideas. I worked on this during an [Amii Hack Night](https://www.amii.ca/) and presented it at [DemoCamp 57](https://democampyeg.com/).

[Here's a demo video](https://www.loom.com/share/bc75679fd59b4380b764b0f502ce051a?sid=d06add8c-9eb4-4a0b-8dea-4564cdc384c1)

Detailed instructions on how to get this running are available in the submodules: [Mercury UI](https://github.com/mikeogezi/mercury-ui) and [Mercury Backend](https://github.com/mikeogezi/mercury-backend).
